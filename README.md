AI Powered Complaint Management System For municipal Services


In urban areas, timely redressal of public grievances is essential for maintaining civic infrastructure and citizen satisfaction. Traditional complaint management systems often suffer from inefficiencies due to the manual handling of complaint prioritization, leading to delays in resolving critical issues. This paper presents Citizen Connect, a web-based public grievance redressal system that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate and optimize the prioritization of complaints. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system analyzes the textual content of user-submitted complaints and classifies them into high, medium, or low priority based on severity and urgency. This enables administrators to focus on critical issues first while ensuring lower-priority complaints are not indefinitely postponed. The platform is developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Firebase for authentication and storage. The proposed system aims to enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency in public service delivery. Future enhancements include model fine-tuning, multilingual support, and real-time feedback mechanisms
